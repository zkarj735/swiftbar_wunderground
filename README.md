# swiftbar_wunderground
Display temperature and humidity from PWS data via Weather Underground

**IMPORTANT** Requires a Weather Underground (WU) API key which can *only* be obtained if you have a Personal Weather Station (PWS)
connected to WU, feeding your data up. Once you have an API key, however, you can specify any station ID in this plugin.

See plugin file for details of how to configure.
